Before Machine Learning became widely popular, did you used to think sentient robots only appeared on Hollywood screens or in cartoons? 

Now, the "*twist*" of Machine Learning is present in our daily lives. This is the era of Machine Learning, where simply scrolling through your phone, entering a search, saving, or liking content are all recorded as data by the machine.

# 1. Overview of Machine Learning
The origin of Machine Learning began in the 1940s-1950s when Alan Turing posed the question: "Can machines think like humans?" which began to permeate the scientific community. 

In 1943, McCulloch and Pitts proposed the first artificial neuron model. This was the most significant turning point for computers and laid the foundation for Machine Learning.

## 1.1. What is Machine Learning?
**Machine Learning is a computer system that learns from data points through a training process**. Once the machine has learned and improved from patterns, it creates algorithmic models that can infer from new data, thereby proposing predictions with high accuracy. 

For example, Machine Learning analyzes web surfing habits through frequently viewed content. It then suggests new videos or products with similar content.

## 1.2. Traditional Programming vs Machine Learning: Key Differences Explained
Systems in traditional programming operate based on simple, pre-written conditional statements such as if-else, case A-B, etc. Thus, the essence of traditional programming is that the machine only does exactly what is written, following stable rules for management and calculation. To change programming in the old way, one must "*fix*" the code. 

Compared to traditional programming, Machine Learning does not require explicit algorithmic descriptions. The core of building a Machine Learning model lies in the data. Machine Learning allows the system to utilize *INPUT* and predict *OUTPUT*, adapting and improving over time as new data is added, with accuracy based on probability.


## 1.3. A Comparison of AI, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
|   | Artificial Intelligence | Deep Learning | Machine Learning |
|---|-----|-----|-----|
| Scope | The broadest field  | A part of AI | A specialized branch of Machine Learning |
| Goal  | Any system that can perform tasks requiring human intelligence | Learning from data and improving over time | dentifying complicated patterns |
| Data |   | Processing structured data | Processing more complicated unstructured data like images/videos (multi-layered neural networks) |
## 1.4. Why Is Machine Learning Important Today?
Scientists began creating programs for computers to analyze large volumes of data, adapt to errors from a constantly changing environment, and solve complex problems beyond human capability. 

Major current technologies all apply Machine Learning, such as climate prediction models, medical diagnosis, real-time autonomous transportation, and more.
