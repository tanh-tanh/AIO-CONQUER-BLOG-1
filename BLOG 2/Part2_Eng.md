## 2. Learning Methods
In general, each learning method has its own effectiveness, and not all methods can be applied to every individual. Therefore, choosing a learning method that suits yourself is an important stepping stone for acquiring knowledge. How do you know which learning style fits you? First, answer the following questions:
1. Time
- The brain only absorbs a certain amount of information within a specific time. Therefore, you need to consider how long your learning duration will be: 1 week, 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year.
2. Subject
- Subjects requiring practice: Most subjects that need practice, such as programming, demand both quantity and time.
- Subjects requiring heavy memorization: Overview the subject to visualize the entire knowledge model. Systematizing subject knowledge can be a powerful assistant for subjects with an overwhelming amount of information.

The AI roadmap is estimated to last up to 1 year. Thus, the learning method depends on your persistence and diligence.

### 2.1 Learning Sources and Scheduling
Currently, AI courses ranging from free to paid can be referenced on platforms such as YouTube, AI Blogs, and courses (DeepLearning, DataCamp, **AI VIET NAM**). Based on the reference materials, you should arrange a reasonable schedule yourself. 

Illustrative example for a 1-week study schedule: 

| Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | ... | Sunday | 
| ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | ------ | 
| --- | Numpy Knowledge <1 hour Code Practice> | Probability and Statistics <Review Chapter 1> Record formulas and re-explain knowledge to A | Specialized English <15 minutes Spaced Repetition> | .... | Weekend Review | 

### 2.2 Effective Learning Methods
Some courses are detailedly designed for users to learn theory in parallel with practice right on their platform. Additionally, you can choose the following learning approach:
- Step 1: Find practice exercises
    - Reference: [AIO Exercise Compilation](https://tutorial.aivietnam.edu.vn/pdf/43)
- Step 2: Learn in order and understand the essence, especially definitions
    - Answer the following questions:
    1. When to use it?
    2. Advantages and disadvantages?
    3. Can it be replaced by another way?
    - Practice: 1 hour/day (depending on needs and urgency)
- Step 3: Write a Blog
    - Create a personal blog to share your knowledge with others. You will fall into the "*Explanation Effect*" when you have to put yourself in the mindset: "*Writing must be correct*"
    - Remark: This is the time when you get to review everything once more and find knowledge gaps quickly and effectively
- Step 4: Participate in projects
    - Choosing personal projects or group projects
    - Competitions: Hackathon, Innovation, Start Up. You are encouraged to participate in team competitions to practice working and coordinating with many people. During the work process, you receive more: advice, problem-solving skills, and more "friction" with real-world problems
